                            I am a Software Engineer based in Edmonton, Alberta. I recently graduated from the
                            University of Alberta in Computer Science and am currently looking for new opportunities.
                            In terms of work, I have an interest in UI/UX Design and Front-End Development.
                            When designing, I personally like a more minimalistic style, as you can probably tell from
                            this webpage. I enjoy playing video games such as Genshin Impact and
                            Valorant or cooking when I am not working. Now that I finished with my self-introduction,
                            come check out what I been working on...
